            <h2>What is the role of laboratory testing in disease detection?</h2>
            <p>Laboratory testing plays a crucial role in diagnosing, monitoring, and managing various diseases. These tests analyze different samples like blood, urine, tissue, and fluids to detect abnormalities that may indicate a specific disease.</p>
            
            <p>Examples of laboratory tests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blood tests: These can check for infections, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and other health markers.</li>
                <li>Urine tests: These can detect signs of infection, kidney function issues, and diabetes.</li>
                <li>Imaging tests: X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs can provide visual representations of internal organs and tissues to identify abnormalities.</li>
            </ul>
